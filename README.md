<h2> ðŸŸ¡ Summary</h2>

In summary, this code creates a tabbed interface where clicking on different tabs displays information and images related to different characters. The active tab is visually indicated by the "active" class, and the background image transitions smoothly when switching between tabs. This CSS code creates a responsive layout with tabs that change appearance when hovered or activated. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, please let me know!
